## Gameplay Tips for Enemy Types

- **Aggressive Enemies (Type 1):** This enemie will relentlessly pursue you. Use vertical movement to your advantage as they struggle with platform navigation. Get into positions where you can attack from far.

- **Mixed-Behavior Enemies (Type 2):** These enemies are slower and more focused on patroling. Time your attacks when they're less focused on you.

- **Platform-Bound Enemies (Type 3):** These enemies stay on their platforms. Use ranged attacks to deal with them safely from a distance, or time your approach when they're moving away from your landing spot.

- **Evasive Enemies (Type 4):** These enemies maintain distance and are difficult to corner. Use the spring platforms to gain height advantage, then glide down for surprise attacks when they're retreating.

- **General Strategy:** Different enemies require different approaches. Observe their behavior patterns before engaging. The AI reacts to your position and actions, so change your tactics if an approach isn't working.

- **Pathfinding Exploitation:** Enemies use paths to navigate - sometimes using vertical platforms to create separation can give you time to recover or plan your next move.
